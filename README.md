## Scene Prompts

| Scene | Image | Prompt |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 01 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 01.png" width="200"> | Three Welsh mountain ponies run together across a steep green hillside: a chestnut brown pony on the left, a dappled gray pony in the center, and a pale white pony on the right. The camera tracks them smoothly from the side at a low angle, keeping all three horses fully in frame as they move in a tight line through tall, wind-bent grass. Their thick manes and tails stream backward, dark and light strands separating clearly with each stride. Soft overcast daylight flattens harsh shadows and brings out the texture of their coats and the uneven terrain beneath their hooves. Grass blurs slightly in the foreground as the three ponies maintain a steady, synchronized pace, with wind and rhythmic hoofbeats filling the soundscape. |
| 02 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 02.png" width="200"> | The camera follows directly behind three Welsh mountain ponies as they climb uphill: a chestnut brown horse on the left, a dappled gray horse in the center, and a pale white horse on the right. Their backs and flowing tails fill most of the frame as they run away from the camera through tall green grass. As the three horses continue uphill, the camera slowly lifts and pulls back, revealing rolling mountain slopes stretching into the distance beneath low gray clouds. Their contrasting coats stand out clearly against the deep green hillside while mist softens the far hills. Hooves strike uneven ground in a staggered rhythm, grass bending and flattening beneath them as steady mountain wind moves through the scene. |
| 03 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 03.png" width="200"> | Three Welsh mountain ponies burst across the frame from left to right, running diagonally downhill through thick grass: a chestnut brown horse enters first, followed closely by a dappled gray horse, with a pale white horse trailing slightly behind. The camera remains mostly fixed and low as the three horses pass close to the lens, briefly filling the frame with powerful legs, churning hooves, and strands of mane whipping past. Grass shakes and parts in their wake, emphasizing speed and weight as they cross the hillside. Soft daylight catches on their coats while the background slope stays stable and calm. The sound of hooves and wind rises sharply, then fades as the three horses exit the frame. |
| 04 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 04.png" width="200"> | Three Welsh mountain ponies move together across a sloping green hillside, seen from directly above: the chestnut brown horse on the left, the dappled gray horse in the center, and the pale white horse on the right. The camera looks straight down from the sky, drifting gently forward as the horses run in a loose line through tall grass. Their bodies form a clear moving pattern against the textured hillside, with grass bending outward from each hoof strike. Soft overcast light flattens shadows, emphasizing coat color and motion rather than contrast. Wind ripples through the grass in long streaks as the three horses continue forward beneath the hovering camera, steady and unified. |
| 05 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 05.png" width="200"> | Three Welsh mountain ponies move at a slower, steady pace along the crest of a grassy ridge: the chestnut brown horse in front, the dappled gray just behind, and the pale white horse last. The camera is positioned low and distant, facing the ridge as the three horses pass across the horizon line from left to right. Soft overcast light places their bodies in partial silhouette against the sky, while long grass sways gently along the ridge. The camera remains still, allowing the horses to cross the frame naturally as clouds drift slowly overhead. Wind moves through the grass with a quiet, open sound as the scene feels calm and expansive. |
| 06 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 06.png" width="200"> | Three Welsh mountain ponies slow slightly as they reach a flatter section of the hillside: the chestnut brown horse eases to the left, the dappled gray horse adjusts its stride in the center, and the pale white horse lifts its head briefly before turning. The camera is positioned at a medium distance, angled slightly downhill, capturing the three horses as they curve together and change direction across the grass. Their hooves dig in and pivot, grass flattening and springing back as their bodies realign. Wind continues to move through their manes as the motion shifts from straight-line speed into a coordinated turn. The scene ends with the three horses moving away in a new direction, steady and unified. |
| 07 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 07.png" width="200"> | The camera drops low to the ground, focused tightly on the hooves of exactly three Welsh mountain ponies moving forward through thick grass: one chestnut brown, one dappled gray, and one pale white. No other horses are present in the frame. A chestnut brown hoof strikes first, followed by the gray and then the white, each step compressing the earth and bending grass flat before it springs back. The camera tracks alongside at hoof level, keeping only the legs and lower bodies of the same three horses in view while their upper bodies remain out of frame. Dirt and grass flick upward with each impact, and the rhythm of movement feels steady and close. The sound of hooves hitting soft ground fills the scene, mixed with wind brushing through grass. |
| 08 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 08.png" width="200"> | The camera moves in close on the heads of three Welsh mountain ponies as they move forward at a steady pace: the chestnut brown horse first, followed by the dappled gray, then the pale white. The frame focuses tightly on their muzzles and nostrils as they breathe, warm air pulsing outward with each exhale. Moist noses flare slightly, whiskers trembling as breath moves through them. The background falls softly out of focus, with only hints of grass and motion passing behind. Wind and breath blend together, creating a quiet, intimate rhythm as the three horses continue forward. |
| 09 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 09.png" width="200"> | The camera moves alongside three Welsh mountain ponies at close range, framed tightly on their necks and shoulders as they move forward through tall grass. The chestnut brown horse leads the frame, followed by the dappled gray and the pale white, their muscles shifting smoothly beneath their coats with each step. Thick manes lift and fall in slow, rhythmic waves as wind passes through them, strands brushing against strong necks. The camera tracks parallel to the motion, keeping the bodies centered while the background grass slides softly past. The sound of wind and faint hoofbeats remains low and steady, creating a calm, intimate sense of movement. |
| 10 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 10.png" width="200"> | The camera moves close alongside three Welsh mountain ponies, framed on their heads from the cheek upward as they move forward at a calm pace. The chestnut brown horse fills the frame first, followed by the dappled gray and the pale white, all remaining close together. Their ears flick and rotate subtly in response to wind and movement, and loose forelock hair lifts and falls across their faces. The camera tracks smoothly at head height, keeping the background softly blurred while facial details remain clear. Wind moves gently through their manes as the scene focuses on alertness and quiet motion rather than speed. |
| 11 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 11.png" width="200"> | The camera moves in close on the head of one Welsh mountain pony, then gently shifts to reveal the others, keeping all three horses present in the scene. The chestnut brown horse fills the frame first, its dark eye blinking slowly as it moves forward. The dappled gray and pale white horses pass just behind, their eyes briefly visible as their heads turn slightly with the terrain. The camera remains steady at head height, capturing subtle movements in ears, eyelids, and facial muscles. Wind moves softly through their forelocks as the scene feels quiet and attentive, focused on awareness rather than speed. |
| 12 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 12.png" width="200"> | Three Welsh mountain ponies stand briefly together in tall grass: the chestnut brown horse nearest the camera, the dappled gray just behind, and the pale white slightly to the side. The camera remains still at chest height, capturing subtle movements rather than motion—slow breathing, ears flicking, and manes shifting gently in the wind. Grass sways softly around their legs while the background hills remain calm and unfocused. No running or sudden movement occurs. The sound of wind and quiet breath fills the scene, creating a moment of calm before motion resumes. |
| 13 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 13.png" width="200"> | The camera pulls back to a medium-wide shot of three Welsh mountain ponies standing together on an open hillside: the chestnut brown, the dappled gray, and the pale white. Wind begins to strengthen, pushing through their manes and tails and rippling the tall grass around their legs. The horses adjust subtly, shifting weight and lowering their heads as the gusts pass over them. Clouds move faster across the sky, softening the light and changing the tone of the landscape. The scene feels unsettled but calm, as the environment begins to take control. |
| 14 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 14.png" width="200"> | The camera holds a medium-wide view of three Welsh mountain ponies standing together on the hillside: the chestnut brown, the dappled gray, and the pale white. As wind continues to move through the grass, clouds drift across the sky, causing the light to subtly shift. Brightness rises and falls across their coats as patches of sunlight briefly break through, then fade again. The horses remain mostly still, only adjusting their stance and turning their heads slightly as the light changes around them. The scene feels unsettled but quiet, as if the weather is deciding what to do next. |
| 15 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 15.png" width="200"> | A light mist begins to drift across the hillside as three Welsh mountain ponies stand and slowly move forward together: the chestnut brown horse, the dappled gray, and the pale white. Fine moisture settles on their coats, slightly darkening the brown and gray while beading softly on the white. The camera holds a medium shot at body height, capturing mist moving across the frame as wind continues to ripple through grass and manes. The horses lower their heads slightly and blink as the air grows heavier. The scene feels quiet and transitional, as the weather begins to touch them directly. |
| 16 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 16.png" width="200"> | Three Welsh mountain ponies begin moving forward together through the mist-covered hillside: the chestnut brown horse on the left, the dappled gray in the center, and the pale white on the right. Their pace is steady and deliberate as light moisture clings to their coats and manes. The camera tracks them from a slight front-side angle at chest height, keeping all three horses clearly in frame as they advance. Mist drifts across their bodies and legs while grass bends under their steps. Wind and distant hoofbeats blend softly as the horses move with calm determination through the changing weather. |
| 17 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 17.png" width="200"> | The camera pulls back to a wide view of three Welsh mountain ponies moving across an open hillside: the chestnut brown, the dappled gray, and the pale white, now small within the frame. Mist and low clouds drift across the landscape, partially obscuring distant hills as wind ripples through tall grass. The horses continue forward together at a steady pace, their movement slow and deliberate against the scale of the terrain. Light remains muted and diffused as weather fills the scene, emphasizing the openness and isolation of the mountains. Wind and distant hoofbeats blend into a broad, atmospheric sound. |
| 18 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 18.png" width="200"> | The camera watches from behind as three Welsh mountain ponies move away together into drifting mist: the chestnut brown on the left, the dappled gray in the center, and the pale white on the right. Their bodies gradually soften in outline as fog thickens around them, blending horse and landscape. Grass sways gently under steady wind while distant hills fade from view. The horses continue forward at the same calm pace, becoming partially obscured by weather rather than leaving the frame. The scene feels quiet and resolved, as the environment fully surrounds them. |
| 19 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 19.png" width="200"> | As the mist begins to thin, three Welsh mountain ponies reappear moving slowly across the hillside: the chestnut brown horse on the left, the dappled gray in the center, and the pale white on the right. Their outlines sharpen as fog lifts just enough to reveal their bodies again, while the ground remains damp and muted. The camera holds a steady medium-wide shot, watching them move calmly forward without urgency. Grass glistens softly under diffused light, and the wind settles into a gentle, even flow. The scene feels quiet and resolved, as if the landscape has exhaled. |
| 20 | <img src="assets/images/LTX-2 I2V WORKFLOW Part 20.png" width="200"> | Soft light begins to filter through thinning clouds as three Welsh mountain ponies move slowly across the hillside: the chestnut brown horse, the dappled gray, and the pale white.
